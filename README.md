# European-Capitals
- Implements an evolutionary algorithm to maximize the length of a route going twice through a given set of 46 capital cities in 2-dimensions.
- Starting, and ending point are open to be determined by the algorithm; each city is visited exactly twice.
- The parameters population-P, parent selection rate-µ and inheritance rate-λ, are to be set by the user at runtime.
- The program outputs the fitness of the best individual, the mean fitness and the least fitness of the parents in every generation in a Gnuplot readable format. 
- Extention of the program to the possibility to find the shortest route going twice through all cities, with the extra constraint to visit at least one other city between visiting one city twice.
